## Use Case 1: Trigger - Identify Affected Appointments with Priority

**Story:** Dr. Sarah Johnson calls in sick for the next 2 weeks

**Actor:** Smart Scheduling Agent

**Trigger:** Therapist status change in EMR

**Pre-conditions:**
- Dr. Sarah Johnson has 15 scheduled appointments
- Patients have varying no-show risk profiles
- Some patients have POC (Plan of Care) expiration dates approaching

**Flow:**

1. System detects therapist unavailability event
2. Query all appointments for therapist T123 (Dr. Johnson) for next 14 days
3. For each appointment, calculate priority score:
   ```
   Priority Score = (no_show_risk * 40) + (poc_urgency * 30) + (revenue_value * 20) + (patient_satisfaction_risk * 10)
   
   Where:
   - no_show_risk: 0-1 (based on patient history)
   - poc_urgency: 0-1 (1 = POC expires within 7 days)
   - revenue_value: 0-1 (normalized appointment value)
   - patient_satisfaction_risk: 0-1 (VIP patients, complaints history)
   ```
4. Retrieve patient data:
   - No-show history (last 12 months)
   - Insurance/payer type
   - POC expiration dates
   - Communication preferences
   - Clinical condition/urgency
5. Sort appointments by priority score (descending)
6. Emit "trigger_detected" event with prioritized list

**Output:**
```
Prioritized Appointments:
1. A001 - Maria Rodriguez - Priority: 87 (no-show: 0.8, POC expires: 7 days)
2. A005 - John Davis - Priority: 78 (no-show: 0.9, chronic condition)
3. A003 - Susan Lee - Priority: 65 (no-show: 0.3, POC expires: 10 days)
...
15. A012 - Tom Brown - Priority: 22 (no-show: 0.1, standard)

High Priority: 5 appointments
Medium Priority: 7 appointments
Low Priority: 3 appointments
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All 15 appointments identified
- No-show risk calculated for each
- POC urgency flagged
- Sorted by priority
- Event emitted within 30 seconds

**Knowledge Required:**
- No-show risk calculation algorithm
- POC urgency thresholds
- Priority scoring weights

- Maria's profile and preferences
- Appointment details

**Pre-conditions:**
- All providers passed compliance filters
- Patient preferences are known
- Provider history with patient is available

**Flow:**

1. Read scoring weights from knowledge document:
   ```
   Scoring Factors (Total: 165 points):

   - Specialty Match: 35 points (exact specialty vs. general)
   - Patient Preference Fit: 30 points (gender, age, language, etc.)
   - Schedule Load Balance: 25 points (lower load = higher score)
   - Experience Match: 20 points (similar/better experience than original provider)
   - Time Slot Priority: 15 points (earlier slot available, or +30 if same provider with earlier slot)
   - Day/Time Match: 10 points (matches patient's preferred day/time)
   ```

   **Detailed Scoring Criteria:**
   
   - **Continuity Score (40 pts):** Rewards providers who have treated the patient before. Helps maintain care continuity.
   
   - **Specialty Match (35 pts):** Ensures provider has the right clinical expertise for the patient's condition.
   
   - **Patient Preference Fit (30 pts):** Considers gender preference, clinic location, age similarity, language, etc.
   
   - **Schedule Load Balance (25 pts):** Prioritizes providers with lighter patient loads to ensure quality of care.
   
   - **Experience Match (20 pts):** NEW - Ensures new provider has similar or better experience level than original provider.
     - Full points: Experience ≥ original provider
     - Partial points: Experience slightly less but still qualified
     - Zero points: Significantly less experienced
   
   - **Time Slot Priority (15 pts):** NEW - Rewards earlier appointment times to minimize patient wait.
     - +30 pts: Same provider with earlier slot available
     - +15 pts: Different provider with earlier slot
     - Partial: Same day but later time
     - Zero: Different day or much later time
   
   - **Day/Time Match (10 pts):** Matches patient's preferred appointment days (e.g., Tuesday/Thursday preference).

2. Score each provider:

   **Provider P001: Dr. Emily Ross**
   ```
   Continuity: 0/40 pts (Maria has never seen Dr. Ross)
   Specialty: 35/35 pts (Orthopedic specialist, exact match for post-surgical knee)
   Patient Preference: 30/30 pts
     - Gender match: +15 pts (female provider, Maria prefers female)
     - Same clinic location: +10 pts
     - Age similarity: +5 pts (both 50s)
   Schedule Load: 20/25 pts (15/25 patients = 60% capacity, well-balanced)
   Experience Match: 20/20 pts (10 years experience, similar to original provider Dr. Sarah - 12 years)
   Time Slot Priority: 15/15 pts (Tuesday 10 AM available - same day as original appointment)
   Day/Time Match: 10/10 pts (Tuesday is Maria's preferred day)
   
   TOTAL: 130/165 pts
   Recommendation: EXCELLENT match despite no prior history
   ```

   **Provider P004: Dr. Michael Lee**
   ```
   Continuity: 40/40 pts (Treated Maria 2 years ago for same knee, excellent history)
   Specialty: 30/35 pts (General PT with orthopedic training, not specialist)
   Patient Preference: 5/30 pts
     - Gender match: 0 pts (male provider, Maria prefers female)
     - Same clinic: +5 pts
   Schedule Load: 8/25 pts (22/25 patients = 88% capacity, near max)
   Experience Match: 15/20 pts (8 years experience, slightly less than original provider)
   Time Slot Priority: 0/15 pts (Thursday 3 PM - different day, later time)
   Day/Time Match: 0/10 pts (Thursday is NOT Maria's preferred day)
   
   TOTAL: 98/165 pts
   Recommendation: GOOD continuity but poor preference match and time availability
   ```

   **Provider P006: Dr. Anna Park**
   ```
   Continuity: 0/40 pts (Never seen Maria)
   Specialty: 32/35 pts (Sports Medicine + Orthopedic, very qualified)

   Time Slot Priority: 10/15 pts (Tuesday 2 PM - same day but later time than original 10 AM)
   Day/Time Match: 10/10 pts (Tuesday is Maria's preferred day)
   
   TOTAL: 113/165 pts
   Recommendation: GOOD alternative if Dr. Ross declines
